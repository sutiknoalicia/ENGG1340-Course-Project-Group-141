### Chosen text-based game:
Risk

### Description of the game:
Risk is an RNG-based conquest game, played by 3-5 players. In Risk, players play on a board depicting a world map separated into 42 different territories, each with their own offensive and defensive advantages. The players can also earn Risk cards to further strengthen their army. It is up to the players to strategically place their color-coded army men to strengthen their offenses and defenses. In order to win Risk, an army must successfully invade all other armies and claim the whole map as theirs and theirs alone, with the added personal touch of being able to form unofficial, often temporary, alliances with other players. However, as per the game’s name, every conflict in Risk is resolved via dice roll, even the toughest defenses can be broken by a lucky roll, and the strongest offenses can be disrupted by a weak dice roll. In Risk, luck is a skill, and playing around said skill is crucial for players to etch out a decisive victory.

### Set-up:
- Players start out by all rolling a dice to decide the turn order, with the person rolling the highest number starting first, the second highest roll going second,     and so on
  - This turn order is consistent for the rest of the game
- Players then take turns to place 1 of their troops on an unoccupied territory
- Then, players add troops to their occupied territories, until all their troops have been deployed
  - The troops need not be evenly distributed.
- Finally, the Risk cards are shuffled, and the game begins proper
- There are 44 Risk cards total: 42 corresponding to each territory, and 2 wild cards
  - Each card has one of 3 symbols, in ascending order of power, they are: infantry, cavalry, and artillery

### Gameplay:
- At the start of each turn, players obtain extra troops equal to the number of territories they own divided by 3, ignoring remainders. If the player occupies all       territories in a certain region, they get extra troops depending on the power of the region
  - They can place these troops in any territory
- If a player has a combination of 3 Risk cards of the same symbol, a combination of 3 Risk cards of 3 unique symbols, or a combination of 2 Risk cards of different     symbols + 1 wild card, they can play the combination to obtain extra troops at the start of the turn
  - At first, players who turn in a set of cards get 4 troops, then each subsequent turn-in adds +2 troops (4 -> 6 -> 8 …)
  - This pattern repeats until the 6th turn-in, which adds +3 from the 5th (12 -> 5)
  - Afterwards, starting from the 6th turn-in, each subsequent turn-add adds +5 troops (15 -> 20 -> 25 …)
- If a player has 5 cards in their deck, they need to make a turn-in
- Afterwards, players can attack any territory adjacent to one that they own, or connected to one they own via sea line
- Both the attacker and the defender will choose any amount of troops to attack and defend with, so long as the number is not more than how many troops they currently   have in the territories being played. This initiates the battle phase
- The attacker and defender will roll a number of die equal to the number of troops they chose to attack/defend with
  - Once both have rolled their die, each side will choose their highest dice rolls and compare them with each other
  - The number of die rolls to be compared depends on the side with the lesser number of die (ex. Attacker rolls 3 die, defender rolls 2, so the 2 highest dice are         compared)
- After a successful attack, players can choose to attack more territories until they either lose an attack, or choose to end their turn
- Once their turn ends, players can choose to move their troops to adjacent/sea line connected territories, so long as each occupied territory has at least 1 troop
- Finally, that player’s turn ends, and the next player plays
- If a player loses all their troops, they are knocked out of the game
  - Whichever player eliminates them will obtain all their Risk cards
- This repeats until 1 player conquers all territories and wins
